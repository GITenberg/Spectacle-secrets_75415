<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> effort of human ingenuity professing to remove or lessen
pain and inconvenience, is, naturally enough, hailed with approbation,
and the public require not so much to be aroused to estimate
fully the advantages proposed, as to be guarded against
implicit belief and heedless confidence in the value and importance
of the remedy. It is, however, of the utmost importance to be
accurately informed what kind of benefit we may fairly expect
from the use of the given means, and to what extent this benefit
may be obtained; and yet the man who steps forward to state
this plainly and fairly, too often fails of the success which his
undertaking deserves. Experience proves that such endeavours
have been contemned by some, looked upon with cold indifference
by others, and viewed with suspicion by nearly all. We are too
apt to suspect interested motives, to doubt the sincerity, and
undervalue the abilities of men, who have devoted their lives, and
the force of their talents, to a particular pursuit; and then, as
though this cunning incredulity was closely allied to implicit credence
in the wildest chimeras, we become ready listeners, and
passive victims, to pompous and plausible charlatans, who make
the largest promises, alike indifferent to the practicability or usefulness
of their specifics. “It is a great mistake,” said an able
English statesman of the last century, “to suppose men harmless
because they are blockheads; the dunce thinks neither of country
nor of consequences in the pursuit of his petty interests and passions,
which may, and often do, lead him to work the greatest
public calamities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span></p>

<p>I have refrained from advancing any crude theoretical opinions,
which might fairly be questioned. The information conveyed
in these pages is of a practical character; has stood the purifying
test of time; and, being based upon the immutable principles of
optical science, courts every enquiry and challenges all investigation.</p>

<p>My object has been to provide the public with a compendium of
sound and standard information on this most interesting and
essential subject, in order that, possessing themselves of the
truth, and becoming conversant with the real merits of the question,
they may no longer be the victims of ignorant, designing,
and knavish speculators, who so mercilessly practise on their
credulity. I have freely availed myself of facts and observations
with which I have become familiar in the course of my own
experience and connexion with an establishment of more than
one hundred years’ standing, and, at the same time, have endeavoured
to condense in one publication the essence of many voluminous
treatises.</p>

<p>“It is only by condensing, simplifying, and arranging in the
most lucid manner possible, the acquired knowledge of past
generations, that those to come can be enabled to avail themselves
to the full of the advanced point from which they will start.”</p>

<p>I have only to add, that though I would not desire to offend the
critical acumen of any of my readers, yet, having but little leisure,
and those moments of rest being snatched from the busy whirl
of commercial pursuits, I have been much more anxious to give
solid information in language universally understood, and divested
of technicalities, than to employ nice set terms, chosen to please
the critic’s curious ear.</p>

<p>The first edition of this work having found a ready sale, spite
of all the opposition and abuse lavished against it by the itinerant
<em>opticians</em>, I have reprinted it with such improvements as the kindness

</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p>“The information which this little book contains is really very
good and very applicable to the instruction both of the short-sighted,
who never reflect before they buy, and of the very long-sighted,
who, from excess of cunning in the search of great bargains,
are, like our friend Moses in the Vicar of Wakefield, open to very
<em>gross</em> impositions in the matter of spectacles and their very <em>chagrin</em>
cases. Those who are not opticians or oculists will do well to read
the book before they commit themselves in the purchase of glasses
either from itinerant or stationary quacks. But this is not all:
though a simple monograph of the frauds of one trade, the book
may be generalized into “a manual of the whole art of puffing,”
and an exposure of the silly credulity of the public in all its
branches. Mr. Cox also discloses some of the machinery of newspaper
puffing in a way which almost tempts us to claim it as “our
thunder,” it is so much in unison with our published opinions on
the subject.”</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Athenæum.</cite><br>
</p>

<p>“In this well-written work Mr. Cox has given a popular description
of the eye, and the adaptation of spectacles to correct
constitutional defects or organic disease: by attention to a few
simple rules which he lays down, any one may effectually fortify
himself against the artful representations of dishonest dealers in
spectacles “made to sell.” The public is indebted to Mr. Cox
for having exposed the tricks of the insidious marauders in several
towns in which they were practising their impositions, and his
tract contains some correspondence between him and several eminent
surgeons, from which it appears that they had been represented
as vouching for pretended improvements in spectacles, of
which they either knew nothing at all, or with regard to which they
themselves had been deceived by the fraudulent pretenders.”</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Christian Advocate.</cite><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>“This is a useful little work, treating on a subject of universal
importance—namely, defining the laws by which deficiency of sight
can be assisted, founded on scientific principles, and aided by extensive
observation in a long practice; we would recommend a perusal
of the pamphlet to such as are about to seek the aid of the
maker of spectacles.”</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Morning Advertiser.</cite><br>
</p>

<p>“This little <em>brochure</em> is correct, ingenious, and useful: moreover,
it is valuable as exposing the gross ignorance, impostures,
and frauds of Jews, pedlars, and other locomotive quacks. The
humbug of <em>amber</em> spectacles, <em>coloured</em> pebbles, clarified crystals,
&amp;c., is here thoroughly exploded. Altogether the information in
this pamphlet is well deserving of attention.”</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Aldine Magazine.</cite><br>
</p>

<p>“An amusing exposure of the puffing and swindling systems
pursued by some self-styled opticians, from which besides may be
gathered a good deal of sound, practical information.”</p>

<p class="right">
<cite>Era.</cite><br>
</p>

<p>“If every body’s sight were impaired, we should strongly hope
that this little treatise would become universally known; but as
we have reason to believe there are some people in the world who
can see a little, we shall only address ourselves to the former, to
whom we can confidently recommend the perusal of this talented
work. Besides a great deal of necessary and sound information
on the use and nature of spectacles, we find a number of <em>exposés</em>
of the tricks pursued by many unprincipled persons styling themselves
opticians, which is put forth by the author in a very distinct
manner.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Science should be stripped of every thing that tends to clothe it
in a strange and repulsive garb, and especially every thing that, to
keep up an appearance of superiority in its professors over the rest of
mankind, assumes an unnecessary guise of profundity and obscurity,
should be sacrificed without mercy.”—<span class="smcap">Sir I. F. W. Herschel.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Spectacles</span> and side-saddles, we are quaintly informed,
became common in England in the reign of Richard the
Second. The ancients, however, knew the power of
burning-glasses, and one cunning rogue, we are told,
discovered a new way to pay old debts, by means of a
round stone or glass used in lighting of fires, with which
he melted the bond, written, as usual in those days, on
wax. Their burning glasses were spheres, either solid
or full of water, their foci were consequently very short
and confused. A long interval occurred before spectacles
were constructed, and three hundred years elapsed
between the invention of spectacles and telescopes.</p>

<p>Our eyes should have our nicest and most tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
care, since it is by them we are familiarized with objects
of the most exquisite interest and beauty, abounding on
the earth we inhabit, and in the starry firmament above
us:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My soul, while Nature’s beauties feast mine eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To Nature’s God contemplative shall rise.”—<span class="smcap">Dodsley.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The faculty of sight should be estimated and regarded
by us with more than ordinary care, when we reflect that
it is the medium through which the most exalted and
gratifying impressions are received; and our watchful
regard to its healthful preservation and agreeable exercise
is the more required from the consideration, that
while to its admirable organization and delicate sense
of perception we stand so much indebted, those very
qualities render it extremely sensitive to injudicious
treatment.</p>

<p>It would be a wholesome, fair, and proper regulation,
to restrain all from practising as opticians but those
practically conversant with the production and application
of lenses for the purpose of aiding the exercise of
sight. It is considered indispensable for the surgeon
and medical practitioner to prepare for his profession by
a course of study, reading, and practical operations, and
to be subjected to an ordeal where his capabilities are
examined and tested. Such an arrangement, though it
<em>may</em> sometimes be abused, guarantees to us practitioners
who understand their duties; and thus are the many
“ills which human flesh is heir to” alleviated and subdued,
while those unfortunates who are practised upon
by the empiric and miracle-monger, have their calamities
aggravated, and their sufferings increased.</p>

<p>It is a question often mooted, how far it is the duty
of a just and equal government to interfere in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
cases for the protection of its subjects: this, however, is
evident, that whatever restrictive laws are framed, if
they are attempted to be enforced while a want of information
prevails upon the subject, the very people for
whose benefit and protection they are introduced, will,
likely enough, view them with distrust and suspicion, and,
until the imposition has been unmasked, will look upon
those who have assumed characters not their own, as
persecuted individuals, entitled to their sympathy rather
than their detestation. It is by diffusing information,
and clearing away obscurity, that we shall erect the best
safeguard against delusion. Those who are ignorant
are consequently credulous, superstitious, and undefended
against the tricks and subtleties of the artful and
designing.</p>

<p>If a book is published, our opinion is almost insensibly
influenced by what the reviewers say of it. If a new
association, a company, or enterprise of any kind is
projected, we look to the list of directors, committee, and
patrons. Our education and universal custom induces
us to pay deference to those whom we suppose to be
possessed of superior information, to be men of character
and reputation, and entitled, from their position in
society, to be regarded with respect.</p>

<p>These legitimate feelings have been so poisoned and
tampered with by those who have designedly entered into
a conspiracy to hoodwink the people, and share the
plunder; and again by the hardly less criminal apathy of
others, who, without dividing the spoil, have suffered the
trickery to pass unexposed; that professional and literary
men cannot but perceive distrust and want of
confidence in their decisions, now becoming general
among the reflecting and intelligent classes of society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
who see that they have been trifled with, and treated as
credulous dupes, and that they really have no guarantee
for the merits of a production, the purity of a proposal, or
the honesty or propriety of any measure to which distinguished
names and lofty patronage are appended. The
exposé of the practices of the railway, mining, and other
bubble schemes illustrates this truth; and the secrets
elicited during the discussion on Mr. Serjeant Talfourd’s
Copyright Bill, clearly demonstrate how infamously the
confidence of “a generous public” has been abused.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The great and benevolent men who existed before us,
and devoted their time and contemplations to the interesting
science of optics, have fully and clearly demonstrated
the laws which regulate the action of light, the
cause and effect of luminous phenomena, and the principles
upon which vision depends. We have the conclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and unvarying results of their numberless experiments,
performed under every modification of circumstances,
to guide us in establishing principles and rules
of action, which the studious and practical opticians of
our own times have tested, and, ascertaining them to be
free from error, now adopt and act upon them.</p>

<p>The captious and consequential may complain of this
admission, as tending to detract from the importance with
which they might otherwise be regarded; but the optician,
who deserves that name, is not anxious to array himself
in borrowed plumage, nor to appropriate as his own that
which rightfully belongs to others. Granted that we
act upon settled and incontrovertible philosophical principles,
is it not infinitely more gratifying to have the
assurance of a correct result, than to be for ever experimentalizing
without arriving at a satisfactory conclusion?
The skilful surgeon and the talented engineer are guided
in their operations by certain fixed and universal laws,
yet no one will dispute that to perform the duties of
either of those professions requires much application,
skill, and expertness. Precisely so with the optician of
the present day. He has fixed, universal, and certain data
for his operations; and it is upon his intimate knowledge
of these, and the careful and judicious application of
them, that his success depends.</p>

<p>When the healthy powers of vision begin to fail, we
feel a tender and anxious concern to perpetuate the
enjoyment we find to be so intimately dependent upon
the uninterrupted exercise of sight, and are instinctively
led to seek for a remedy. Much mischief will be
avoided, and misapprehension removed, if we consider
that in applying artificial aid to the eye, we have to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
one of our most sensitive and easily deranged organs.
The human eye is composed of a series of humours and
membranes: the outer coating, called the <em>sclerotica</em> (<em>a</em>),
see <em>Plate, Fig. <a href="#no1">1</a></em>, is exceedingly strong, and the muscles
which move the eye are attached to it; the white of the
eye is a portion of this coating. The <em>cornea</em> (<em>b</em>) arches
out or projects from the eye-ball; it is transparent, and
of a circular form. The next coating to the sclerotica
is called the <em>choroides</em> (<em>c</em>); it has no muscular motion
except at its extremities, near the front of the eye. The
<em>iris</em> (<em>d</em>) is next apparent; it attaches itself to the sclerotica
by a cellular substance called the <em>ciliary circle</em> (<em>e</em>).
According to the colour of the iris the eye is termed
black, blue, hazel, &amp;c. It is composed of two sets of
muscular fibres, the one tending, like radii, towards a
centre, the other forming a number of circles concentric
with the same centre. The aperture in the iris is
called the <em>pupil</em> (<em>f</em>); it is always round, but varies in
diameter as the radial or the circular fibres of the iris
are contracted or expanded, according to the quantity
and quality of light it is required to admit, acting like a
watchful centinel to regulate the amount of rays requisite
to transmit a perfect and well-defined image of objects
onwards to the brain, which, without its agency, would
appear one undistinguishable mass of confusion. The
chamber of the eye is darkened by the posterior surface
of the choroid membrane having a lining of dark-coloured
mucus, called the <em>pigmentum nigrum</em>. The last coating
of the eye is the <em>retina</em> (<em>g</em>), a delicate and most important
membrane in the construction of this noble instrument;
it is an expansion of the <em>optic nerve</em> (<em>h</em>), directly
emanating from the brain; and is spread like a net of
exquisite delicacy all over the surface of the choroides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
terminating at the ciliary ligament. It receives the
images of objects by means of the rays of light that enter
at the pupil; it is transparent, but appears black on
account of the dark pigmentum behind it. The optic
nerve passes through a small aperture in the “<em>architectural
dome</em>” containing the eye, and it conveys the
impressions made on the retina into the depository of the
brain, where the “very form and spirit of the scene is
now conceived.” It is situated a little on one side of
the centre of the eye, inclining towards the nose.</p>

<p>To describe more minutely the various fibres, humours,
and ciliary processes of the eye, or to enter more fully
into its anatomical arrangement, would be incompatible
with the design of this publication, which is intended for
the “general reader,” and therefore so simplified as that
it is hoped he cannot fail to understand. The three
transparent humours enclosed by the coats of the eye,
viz., the <em>aqueous</em> (<em>i</em>), the <em>chrystalline</em> (<em>k</em>), and the
<em>vitreous</em> (<em>l</em>), are, however, too important to be passed
over without some notice. The aqueous (<em>i</em>) humour it
is which gives a protuberant figure to the cornea (<em>b</em>); it
has a refractive power, similar to that of water, which it
also resembles in appearance. The chrystalline (<em>k</em>)
humour is more transparent than the purest chrystal;
its form is that of a double convex lens, which it also
resembles in its use, as it converges the rays which pass
through it, from every visible object to its focus on the
retina. It is suspended in a fine transparent sheathing.
The shape or convexity of this natural lens alters occasionally,
and shifts a little backwards or forwards in the
eye, so as to adapt its focal distance from the retina
to the different distances of objects. The vitreous
humour is situated at the back of the chrystalline, filling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
nearly three-fourths of the globe of the eye; it is surrounded
by a thin capsule, which sends off a number of
membranous processes into the vitreous substance, where
they form cells, which, communicating with each other,
give a high degree of firmness and tenacity to the whole.</p>

<p><em>Fig. <a href="#no2">2</a>.</em> represents the eye at the time when spectacles
are required, the cornea, or the chrystalline, or both,
having lost a part of their natural convexity, consequent
upon age or constitutional weakness. An object placed
at the same distance from the eye as in the perfect eye,
(<em>Fig. <a href="#no1">1</a></em>), has the focus carried beyond the retina. A
convex lens applied to the eye compensates for this loss
of capacity, and, converging the rays, corrects the focal
distance, and the image is now imprinted naturally on
the retina. The reverse of this takes place in the case
of the short-sighted; the humours being <em>more</em> convex
than in the perfect eye, the rays converge in a focus
<em>before</em> they reach the retina. A concave lens carries
the focus further on, and, by its aid, an object will be
depicted perfectly on the retina.</p>

<p>No. 4 represents a plano convex lens—5, a double
convex—6, a plano concave—7, a double concave—8,
a periscopic or meniscus lens.</p>

<p>What grandeur and sublimity of contrivance is here
blended with simplicity of action and power of expression!
How indispensable to a full appreciation of the
bounties of nature and the beauties of art by which we
are surrounded! To be deficient of this heavenly gift is
truly to have “wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.”</p>

<p>Surely every consideration should influence us to
treat this invaluable faculty with judicious care, instead
of allowing it to be tortured and trifled with by the
ignorant and unprincipled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Having surveyed the general construction, and glanced
at the inimitable mechanism of those windows of the
soul, we shall be better prepared to understand the
reasoning, and to comprehend the principles upon which
the science of optics is based. Those of my readers
who have leisure to pursue this subject, will find new
light, and more convincing illustrations attend their
enquiry at every step. It is a subject abounding in
beauty and interest, introducing us to new regions of
sublimity and grandeur, where the contemplative mind
will assuredly find “ample scope and verge enough” to
gratify its most exalted anticipations. We have seen
the admirable, yet at the same time delicate contrivances
by which the functions of the eyes are performed.
It cannot fail to have occurred to us, that a
machine so beautiful and complete is liable to derangement
and improper treatment by the wayward and the
ignorant. If it is desirable that a person possessed of
a well-constructed watch should understand its general
action, and know what treatment it should have to
keep it in sound and underanged order, still more
essential is it that every individual should possess a
clear and familiar knowledge of the nature of vision,
and understand the requirements of the eyes. I cannot
forbear indulging a sanguine hope that the circulation
of this little manual will open the eyes of its readers to
the simple facts of the case, and animate them to
think and judge for themselves, instead of giving a
ready ear to the marvellous and ridiculous tales, which,
though, like the sailor’s tough yarn, so often told that the
cheat believes them himself, are nevertheless utterly
devoid of truth.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> In the month of August, 1838, the solicitor to the Duke of
Wellington waited upon Sir Frederick Roe, at Bow-street, in reference
to the use which had been made of his grace’s name by
“The London Equitable Loan Company.” A gentleman, who
was desirous of purchasing shares in the company, seeing the Duke
of Wellington mentioned as patron, and that the account of the
company was kept with the Bank of England, wrote to the Duke
to ascertain if it were true that he was connected with the concern?
The duke never had consented to become a patron, but, on the
contrary, when asked to do so, answered that he was so situated
that he could not comply with their request. On receiving the
communication the duke wrote to Sir F. Roe, to see what could be
done to guard the public against any transaction which might be
entered into in consequence of the use made of his name; and in
answer to a letter written by him to the Bank of England, he was
informed “that no such company was known there, nor had
they any account of the London Equitable Loan Company.” The
publicity given to this manœuvre has no doubt saved many a
family from enthralment and destitution.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> eyes, when in a sound and healthy state, instinctively
adjust themselves at a distance of twelve inches
from a book or paper, when they are observing the
same. This distance is found to be most natural and
agreeable; for when we extend it to sixteen, twenty, or
thirty inches, the chrystalline lens is stimulated to keep
a distinct and clear perception, until, as the distance
increases, the object becomes less and less perceptible.
When we are compelled to extend this natural distance,
experience difficulty in reading small characters, or find
it necessary to get more light on what we are observing,
we may safely conclude that artificial assistance is
needed, and that, judiciously applied, the tendency to
decay will be mildly arrested.</p>

<p>The design of spectacles is to supply the loss of
power which is experienced by the eyes at different
periods of life, and arising from various causes. These
productions of art are constructed with a close observance
to, and act upon, the same principles as those by
which the process of vision is regulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Spectacles ought not to do more than maintain or
preserve to us the capability of seeing at the natural
distance. This is, in fact, all they are intended to
effect. When the chrystalline lens of the eye, losing
its convexity, fails to converge the rays of light, and
bring them to their natural focus on the retina, an
artificial lens, of suitable convexity, supplies to it this
capability, and compensates for its gradual diminution
of capacity. Thus lenses for assisting the sight are
fashioned upon the optical principles so apparent in the
mechanism of the eye itself, which, it will be observed,
is neither round nor flat, but of that nicely moulded
convexity which is indispensable for the performance of
its functions. If lenses were either spheres or planes
they likewise would be ineffective for the purpose
proposed.</p>

<p>There is not any material in existence beside pebble
and glass, which is calculated for spectacle purposes.
The pretended “improvements,” “pellucid lenses,”
“refractive transparencies,” “patent amber,” “chrystal
preservers,” &amp;c., are new-fangled terms, coined to entrap
the uninitiated.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Convex lenses are produced by a series of operations
through which a glass or pebble passes, as shaping out
from the rough piece, affixing them to the block or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
frame on which they are worked, grinding their surfaces
to the form and focus required, in brass or iron tools of
the curvature or radius corresponding. Thus to produce
a glass or pebble of any given focal length, we
use a tool which is a portion of a sphere or globe of
four, five, ten, or any other given radius, or half its diameter.
For spectacles usually required, the focus of the
pebble or glass, thus fashioned, varies from sixty inches
down to five inches. The focus of a convex or magnifying
glass is ascertained very readily, thus: hold the
lens near to a white surface, as a sheet of writing
paper, pinned to the side of the apartment opposite to
the window; shift the lens gently backwards and forwards,
until the objects before it, as the window frames,
flower pots, or the Venetian blinds, are seen inverted
upon the paper, clearly and distinctly measure the distance
from the paper to the lens, and this distance is the
focus: or, by placing a candle at the distance of twelve
feet from the paper, and measuring, as before, when the
reflected image of the flame is shown most accurately on
the paper, we again have the focus denoted. The one
method is as much practised as the other; though, in
ordering a lens of a given focus, I would recommend a
person always to state the method by which he has
determined the focus; whether by the sun, or candlelight,
which will prevent any mistake arising from the
disparity between the two plans pursued.</p>

<p>Concave lenses are made upon the same principle, and
pass through similar processes. They are designated
by numbers, thus: a concave lens, worked in a tool of
four-inch radius, is termed No. 12; five-inch, No. 10;
ten-inch, No. 6. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>To determine the radius or focus of a concave lens,
apply to its surface a convex lens of the same focus,
and holding the two together as one glass, between the
thumb and finger, at some distance before the eye, give
the hand a gentle motion to and fro, and if the objects
looked at through the lenses now in contact appear
fixed, equal, and of their natural size, then is the focus
of the one correspondent to that of the other; but if
the convex lens is not of the same focal length as the
concave to which it is thus applied, then all objects
looked upon will appear to shake and have a tremulous
motion.</p>

<p>Another method of ascertaining whether one concave
lens is of the same number, and worked in tools of the
same radius as another, is to hold one in each hand,
placing their edges against each other, with their centres
in a parallel line; now withdraw ten or twelve feet from
the window, and observe the top and bottom bars of a
square of glass: if they appear equal and uniform in all
their parts, parallel to each other, and agreeing with the
other squares in the window, then are they of the same
radius; but if they do not match, the bars will appear
disjointed, and higher or lower in one square than in the
other. The trial box of sights will be found very useful
in making these experiments.</p>

<p>Brazil pebbles, or crystallized quartz, are imported to
this country in rough blocks; these are cut or slit, by
the aid of pulverized diamond, into slabs or pieces, of
the diameter required. Those pieces in which bubbles,
waves, or blemishes appear, are thrown aside by the
optician who is tenacious of his fair fame, as their imperfections
become more apparent in every after-stage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
their progress; and when polished, centred, and shaped
for the spectacle-frame, they are really improper to be used
at all; nevertheless, the needy, or dishonest, rather than
lose a fraction of their gains, often persist in working up
such imperfect material, and harping upon their being
pebble—real pebble—palm them off upon the uninitiated
as genuine articles. Pebbles have the following important
advantages: they are of equal density, and
exceedingly hard, firm, and clear; their surfaces are not
liable to become misty or scratched (which circumstance
alone often compels a change of glasses): they are of a
pure, cool nature, and shew this contrast to glass (which
is, on the contrary, produced by the action of artificial
heat) in the touch of the finger or tongue to their
surfaces.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They are, in consequence of these properties,
calculated to suit the sight for a longer period than
glass; but they need not be thrown aside, when, from
the indications already referred to, we find an increase of
magnifying power is required, as they can be re-worked
readily enough to meet the requirement of the eyes, and
at an expense scarcely more than a new pair of glasses,
or about one-third of their original cost. The directions
for ascertaining the focus of concave or convex pebbles,
are the same as described for concave or convex glasses.</p>

<p>This consideration should weigh with those who are
apt to be misled by the pretensions of the unprincipled;
for pebbles have, in common with many other crystals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
a double refracting property, which, if the pebble is cut
carelessly, exhibits itself by painfully affecting the vision;
two objects, instead of one, are seen, causing a confused
and agitating sense of indistinctness, which, in proportion
to the exertion of the eye to overcome it, is the more
tiresome and distressing. Such faulty and blemished
articles, technically called <em>wasters</em>, are refused by the
optician of any real respectability and character, but are
eagerly bought up by those venders, whose object is to
purchase what costs them the least money, alike ignorant
of, and indifferent to, any other consideration.</p>

<p>Pebbles, therefore, like all the precious stones, which,
in fact, are crystals, cannot be properly cut or sliced
except in a parallel direction to their natural faces.</p>

<p>Periscopic or meniscus lenses were introduced in the
year 1770, and revived at a later period by Dr. Wollaston.
Their properties were investigated by many scientific
persons, and again candidly examined by Mr. W. Jones;
yet, notwithstanding the oblivion to which they were
consigned by the universal consent of practical opticians,
they are still foisted on the public, under various disguises,
and embellished with sundry new appellations.
They are concave on one side, and convex on the other,
the inner and outer curve differing, in order to produce a
focus. When placed in the spectacle-frame, their convex
surface is always from the eye; this necessarily exposes
their centres to be rubbed and scratched. The
halo, or aberration of light, is greater in lenses of this
form than in any other. This can be easily proved by
placing a double convex, and a periscopic lens, each of
the same diameter and focus, say one-and-a-half inch diameter,
and three or four inch focus, edgeways together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Let the image of a lighted candle be thrown against a
white wall or paper, in a dark situation, through the
two lenses, and it will be conspicuously seen that the
periscopic lens exhibits this dazzling indistinctness,
while in the double convex lens it is scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>Parallel or flat surface lenses are produced from tools
perfectly level, and without any curvature. For spectacle
purposes their only use is as shades or shields for the
eye, to protect it from the effects of bright and dazzling
objects, dust, and wind. They are, however, indispensable
in the construction of sextants, artificial horizons,
and other mathematical instruments.</p>

<p>Spectacles for travelling by rail-road, on the old
beaten path, or by vessels, are usually fitted with parallel
glasses, unless the wearer requires focal power as well
as a screen, in which case they are of the concave or
convex figure, before explained. Almost every combination
of light and shade has been used for this class
of spectacles; violet, grey, blue, green, crape, wove
wire, &amp;c.; but some sensitive and tender eyes failed to
receive the relief expected from any of these, and
opticians have been repeatedly baffled in their attempts
to produce a shade of glass congenial to the requirements
of the eye under such circumstances. I have
made extensive use of the new neutral tint, or twilight
tinge glass, and find it most agreeable to the eye while
employing it, and when removed, it leaves the vision
undisturbed by the flickering and confused halo so much
complained of after wearing other coloured glasses.
The cause of this superiority is clearly seen when we
remember that, after taking off a pair of green glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
spectacles, every object appears of a red colour, while,
upon the removal of blue colours, an orange or yellow
mantle seems to rest on all which meets the view.</p>

<p>It is of consequence that all such glasses should be
really parallel, otherwise a broken and disjointed appearance
will be given to objects, the rays of light being
abruptly dispersed instead of being transmitted through
the transparent medium to the eye, in their natural
direction. I have always discountenanced the use of
wire, gauze, crape, and muslin substitutes for glass,
because, in my opinion, it is a fallacy to assert that they
are cooler and more agreeable to the eye. There is abundant
space for the circulation of air in the region of the
eye if the spectacle-frame adapts itself pleasantly to the
wearer’s face; while the eye and common sense may
answer together, that to look on things around us, a
transparent medium is preferable to a hazy and indistinct
one. We do not choose bars and gratings, or coarse
curtains, in preference to glass, for the windows of
apartments; but if the light is sometimes too intense,
we place a shade to soften its dazzling effects. Such
precisely is the reason why tinted glass spectacles, for
defending the eyes from rain, dust, and wind, are recommended.</p>

<p>Lenses worked by machinery are produced in greater
quantities, within a given time, than those worked by
hand. They are passed through the different stages of
grinding and polishing without having the keen eye of
the workman carefully watching their progress, and
adjusting the inequalities in their surfaces or edges,
which will always appear more or less in the course of
working.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The price at which competition demands those lenses
shall be rendered, operates against the wearer of spectacles;
for the producer cannot afford to throw aside such
as are faulty, and the wholesale agent and retail dispenser
cannot expect to have, at the low price charged,
lenses which will bear a critical examination; and thus
all which can possibly be used are thrust into frames of
one kind or other, from the common iron or horn sold
by the poor hawkers at sixpence, eightpence, and
one shilling per pair, to the more expensive frames;
while many faulty glasses, after being dubbed with some
ear-tickling appellation, and imbibing extraordinary
“light-modifying and refractive virtues,” by passing
into the hands of the hawker of a higher class, are
palmed upon the unfortunate spectacle-purchasers who
are simple enough to give credence to the wondrous
tale.</p>

<p>Women and children are chiefly employed to cut
and edge those cheap glasses to the spectacle-frames;
and who can expect they should do them better for the
price? And if one glass should be unequally thick, like
a wedge, while its companion in the same spectacles is
miserably thin; or if the centres, instead of being equidistant
from all parts of the rim are nipped into a
corner; how <em>can</em> you feel surprised when you consider
that for them to earn a living, it is necessary they should
finish several dozen pairs per day, and therefore, expedition,
rather than excellence, is the point at which they
aim? In many departments, where machinery has
supplanted manual labour, the work produced is of a
superior character, and will bear more critical examination;
but the contrary is the fact in the case of machine-worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
optical glasses, and is more especially apparent
in such as are intended for microscopic and achromatic
purposes. It cannot be denied that, for all such uses,
lenses worked by hand, with the ordinary care of a skilful
workman, as much excel those produced by machinery,
as the accurate and scientific touch of the artist
eclipses the random splash of the plasterer.</p>

<p>The trial box, or frame of sights, ranging from the
slightest focal power down to the deepest, is a very
useful apparatus, both for the optician and his patient.
It consists of eight or nine spectacle-fronts, clamped
together at one end by a rivet, on which they are yet
free to move. The focus of each pair is stamped on the
front. They are enclosed by a pair of lids, which forms
a handle, to be held by the hand, while one front after
another is placed before the eyes, to determine what
focus yields the desired assistance. This being ascertained,
and having noted down the power we find to
suit most naturally, as explained when treating of convex
lenses, page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>, we have only to determine what style
of mounting we prefer, and whether we will have
glasses or pebbles, for the optician to suit us at once
with lenses adapted to the sight, and mountings fitting
pleasantly to the head. If an interview with the optician
is impracticable, it will be ensuring greater accuracy, to
mention the exact distance, measured as a straight line
from the centre of the pupil of one eye to that of the
other; and if the nose, on the bridge between the eyes,
is flat or prominent, broad or narrow, since spectacles,
suiting the sight most accurately, are frequently an
annoyance, rather than an assistance, to the wearer,
from these particulars being unheeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Two trial boxes comprise the range of convex sight,
one for young persons, and those who require spectacles
for the first, second, or third time; the other for those
eyes which have been long accustomed to spectacles, or
from some constitutional or sudden cause, need those of
strong magnifying power. The third box contains concave
lenses, ranging from No. 1 to 12, which are the
sights chiefly wanted, although, in extraordinary cases,
No. 13, 14, and even 20, have been required.</p>

<p>Although, throughout this treatise, I have endeavoured
to convince my readers that they may and ought
mainly to determine for themselves, yet I would recommend
a visit to the optician, where it is practicable, in
preference to a description of the case; for the same
reason that the best written statement of a patient’s
malady, sent to a physician, does not afford him that
familiar acquaintance with the case which an interview
of a few minutes would supply.</p>

<p>“Every day’s observation shews how far some men may be carried
from the most evident and obvious truths, to support a new hypothesis,
which has no foundation either in nature or reason; but truth
will ever control and prevail over error, though supported with all
the powers of rhetoric and novelty.”—<span class="smcap">B. Martin.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Where</span> distance, or any other cause, prevents our having
access to persons who are competent to suit us properly
with spectacles, great care should be exercised to choose
those which cause the print of a newspaper, or the
ordinary types of a book, to appear of their natural and
proper size, while they are viewed at the distance most
agreeable for reading, viz., twelve inches from the eye.
It is evidently better to “try spectacles” on such
ordinary printing as they will be generally exercised
upon, than to test them by the very small print with
which persons frequently provide themselves. To decipher
this, a greater power is demanded than is requisite
for usual reading, writing, and needlework, which are
the purposes for which we require them, and not for
microscopic observation, nor for distant views.</p>

<p>The eyes in which no malformation or disease exists,
but which simply partake of constitutional decay, or,
from too continued application to sedentary and studious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
pursuits, are beginning to feel a want of assistance, should
have spectacles of sixty-inch focus, which is an exceedingly
slight magnifying power; and if these are found
to be insufficient to afford an agreeable and natural
perception (not an enlarged or magnified image of the
letters of a book, &amp;c., held in the hand at the distance
of twelve or fourteen inches from the eye), then apply
those of the next power, viz., forty-eight inches’ focus.
If these again are unequal to supply the loss of power
or incapacity of the eye to converge the light to a point
at the instant it reaches the retina, then lenses of thirty-six
inches focus are to be had recourse to; and when
these fail to afford agreeable vision, thirty, twenty-eight,
twenty-four, twenty, must be progressively adopted,
thus gradually descending the scale until the eyes
receive such compensation for their progressive decay
and loss of power, as spectacles carefully suited to the
sight are capable so effectually to supply.</p>

<p>The period at which the sight begins to fail does not
at all depend on age, but varies in different persons
according to the formation of the eyes, the treatment
they have received, and the constitutional capability;
therefore, the age of the person requiring spectacles
gives but a vague general idea to the optician as to what
is required, unless other particulars are stated; such as
whether glasses have been used before; the distance at
which writing and printing is seen pleasantly without
assistance, the focus of those last used, or sending even
but a broken piece of the same.</p>

<p>“The proper selection of spectacles for imperfect
vision is a point of much deeper importance than is
generally believed. An <em>oculist</em> who is only acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
with the diseases of the human eye, without possessing
any knowledge of it as an optical instrument, is often
led professionally to recommend glasses when they
ought not to be used, or to fix on focal lengths entirely
unfit for the purpose to which they are applied, and the
<em>mere vender</em> of spectacles and lenses is still more frequently
in the habit of proffering such counsel.”—<span class="smcap">Brewster.</span></p>

<p>The near-sighted, or those who require concave
spectacles should use those of the slightest power;
No. 0, or No. 1, will generally be sufficient at first,
but this, by the aid of the trial box, can readily be
determined by the wearer himself. There is such an
immense benefit experienced by the short-sighted from
spectacles which suit their sight, that to argue for their
adoption of them would be quite superfluous. Without
spectacles they are excluded from observing beautiful
landscapes, recognizing individuals, or viewing to advantage
any of the crowd of interesting objects around
them; but by adopting them they are placed on a par
with the long-sighted in such circumstances, while the
sharp and microscopic character of their sight <em>without</em>
spectacles, gives them many advantages over those possessing
ordinary vision.</p>

<p>The short, or near-sighted eyes, have the cornea, and
often the crystalline lens, more convex or arched out
than in long-sighted eyes. This formation causes the
rays to converge to a focus before they reach the retina,
but by the application of a concave lens the difficulty is
corrected, and the rays are carried on to their proper
point for giving a perfect representation on the retina.</p>

<p>This character of sight is very frequent, and is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
particularly remarkable among those whose mode of life
restricts them to crowded cities, sedentary employments,
and confined situations. Those whose infantine and
youthful years have been passed in the country, or where
the eyes have had a free range of view, not circumscribed
by the walls of the nursery, or limited to the
observation of objects near at hand, rarely require concave
spectacles.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The spectacle-frames next demand our attention, as
our utmost care in judiciously selecting lenses of the
proper focus for our sight will be neutralized if the frame
or mounting in which they are placed does not apply
comfortably to the head, leaving the lenses they carry
fair and parallel before the eyes. If the front of a pair of
spectacles is too short for the wearer’s face, he will look
upon the edge of the lens, and a portion of the exterior
rim of the frame; if they are too long his eye will meet
the opposite edge and inner curve of the rim.</p>

<p>Spectacle-frames are fashioned to suit the variety of
formation in different individuals, and therefore such
should be applied as adapt themselves pleasantly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
temples, across the forehead and before the eyes. The
pupil of the eye should, when looking at an object
directly before it, see through the centre of the spectacle-eye,
so that if the whole of the glass, except the small
centre, were painted black, the rays of light would pass
through it without distortion of the pupil. The bridge
or nose-part of the spectacle-frame should be arched
out, made like the crank of a lathe, or perfectly parallel
with the knuckles of the sides, according to the formation
of the wearer’s nose, otherwise the spectacles sit
awkwardly on the face too far from or too near to the
eye-lashes, with their centres too high or too low for the
natural exercise of sight. Trifling as these particulars
may seem, they cannot be neglected with impunity.
Where these defects are unattended to, the eye is tortured
by straining to overcome the difficulty, and striving
to accommodate itself to them, instead of their being
shaped to meet its requirements. Some old-fashioned
spectacles have short side-pieces, which press most unpleasantly
on one point of the temples, and when closed
scratch and rub the lenses. Others have very cumbrous
and heavy sides, with double lift or common hinge-joints.
These also scratch the lenses when folded up,
and can only be worn with any degree of comfort when
the head is uncovered. Decidedly the best constructed
spectacle-frames are those which, without being clumsy,
have enough strength to admit of the sides being extended
the full width of the face without bending the
front, with single sides rather longer than their front for
ladies’ use, and with turnpin sides (an extending joint,
turning on a pivot,) for gentlemen.</p>

<p>The material of which they are composed should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
either gold, silver, or enamelled blue steel. Tortoiseshell,
also, when well made, is very light and pleasant to
wear, particularly for ladies. There is no advantage in
large size, or round-eye spectacles, to compensate for
their clumsy appearance and great weight; we get a
sufficient expanse of observation with the oval-shape
glasses without harassing the eye with an excess of
light, which the large glasses admit.</p>

<p>Solid blue steel mountings are a decided improvement,
and are invaluable for persons who constantly require
spectacles. They are wrought from a plate of steel, and
shaped as light and uniform as any other town-made
elastic blue-steel spectacles, with the advantage of being
more durable, and eventually less expensive; for as they
have no soldering in their composition, it is scarcely
possible to break them, and therefore they rarely want
repairing. Blue steel spectacles, in consequence of their
being so much in request, are coarsely imitated, and vast
numbers are sold by the pretended cheap shops, at
apparently low prices which the wearer will find to
be immensely beyond their real value. There are
thirteen different qualities of the spectacles termed blue
steel. The chief part are country made, and roughly
put together, some being all iron, others having iron
fronts and steel sides; others again bear a tolerably
close resemblance to the best town-made articles, and
unless the two are compared together, are likely to
deceive a casual observer.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>The fine elastic blue steel, of the best quality, are
exceedingly light, highly polished, and beautifully enamelled.
They will retain their appearance for two or
three years, when carefully used; and they can be
restored to their original appearance at any time for a
few shillings’ expense.</p>

<p>The anti-pressure spectacles are made of gold, silver,
or the elastic steel. They are not adapted for ladies’
use, but for gentlemen have been much in demand, as
they obviate the necessity of opening and closing a second
joint or lengthening piece, and do not press or annoy
the nose or temples, but by an equal tenacity preserve
their proper position before the eyes.</p>

<p>Single eye-glasses, though very convenient for occasional
use, are not to be compared with spectacles for
the agreeable and natural assistance they give to vision.
The eye should not be dependent on them for continuous
assistance. Those who persist in using them should do
so as little as possible; but the wiser course is to discard
them entirely, and adopt the double eye-glasses where it
would be tedious to apply spectacles of the usual kind.</p>

<p>That the vision is more natural and perfect when both
eyes are employed than when one glass only is used,
must be self-evident, as the axis of each glass, placed as
they should be in the spectacles, coincides with the axis
of each eye, and the rays of light are thus equally
refracted to the eye. Again, the eyes have a most
acute and sensitive sympathy with each other, and when
a single eye-glass is constantly used they are unnaturally
exercised, and prevented from acting in concert. One
eye (generally the right eye) has the glass perpetually
applied to it; and very frequently, in consequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
this pernicious practice, becomes of a different focus to
the other. Mr. George Adams informs us that he did
not recollect an instance of a short-sighted person who
had occasion to increase the focus of his concaves if he
began by wearing spectacles, but that the cases were
frequent, where a single eye-glass had been used, in
which the persons had frequently required a change of
glasses.</p>

<p>The prices of spectacles are diversified and fluctuating,
like all other manufactures, so that to publish a list of
prices would only tend to mislead and deceive my
readers. For instance, the price of a pair of pebbles,
used formerly to be one guinea extra to the charge for
glasses; they are now reduced to half that sum. A
pair of pebbles, of the concave or of the periscopic
figure, were at the same time charged twenty-five
shillings. These have been reduced in the same proportion.
And it cannot be too universally known, that a
person can have a pair of good convex glasses fitted into
his spectacles, and correctly suited to his sight, at from
one shilling and sixpence to two shillings per pair, by
any respectable optician. The poorest person may be
defended against the tender mercies of the spectacle
speculators; for he really can obtain a better article for
his money, both in quality and suitableness to his sight,
of the respectable optician, and, upon an average, at <em>a
less cost</em> than the cheat contrives, by dint of manœuvring,
to extract from him. Good lenses, in plain frames, or,
in other words, a good pair of spectacles, may be had,
correctly suited to the sight, for two shillings and sixpence.
Who then, knowing this, would suffer his
sight to be tampered with? Truly, those who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
stickle for a shilling in the price of such valuable and
essential instruments</p>

<p class="no-indent">Yet, at the same time, there is no reason why those
exorbitant charges should be submitted to, which are
often paid without hesitation by the delighted purchaser,
when a pair of spectacles appears to suit his sight.</p>

<p>The love of the marvellous, and the insane thirst for
novelties, are strikingly displayed in many inquirers for
spectacles. The honest, straight-forward, and disinterested
counsel of the established tradesman, is looked
upon with scowling suspicion; but the preposterous and
shallow pretensions of the empiric, decked with all the
paraphernalia of fudge and falsehood, are listened to
with eager curiosity. If the writer looked to self-interest
as his guiding star, his course would be to preserve
silence on these subjects; since it needs not to be
demonstrated, that the practice and the profit of the
regular practitioner are increased by the patched-up and
mangled cases, which are, as it were, provided for him,
over and above the number who <em>legitimately require</em> the
exercise of his skill. But he despises such mercenary
calculations, and contends that “The happiness of mankind
at large is a principle that ought to be followed out
by all individuals at every personal cost, and against
every kind of opposition.”—<cite>Medical Examiner.</cite></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> In Russia the person having short sight is seated in a chair for
several hours daily, with the head placed in a natural position for

humours of the eyes, constantly exercised in endeavouring to accommodate

at length acquire the capability of observing at the usual distance.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly the fact that this character of sight may be

<p>We have only to glance at the columns of our newspapers,
and the covers of periodical publications, for
illustrations of the extent to which the system of
scheming, falsehood, and trickery, termed puffing, is carried.
In one specious and lofty-toned announcement we
are told that the most splendid discovery of the present
age is now admitted, by the most unquestionable (?) testimonials,
to be “Grindstone Snuff,” which is warranted
to cure gutta serena, cataract, and all other diseases of
the eyes, while a single pinch scares away headache and
nervousness! Another startles the weatherwise by his
impudent pretension to be the <em>only</em> maker of barometers
and thermometers in London; whereas, if the real truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
were disclosed, it would be found that his connexion with
the trade consisted in some such occupation as engraving
the index plates of the instrument for his employers,
who surely have the greater right to be considered real
makers. Balsams, cough drops, rheumatism and gout
dispersers, pills, cerates, syrups, shaving soaps, cornplasters,
and heal-alls—all boast of the wondrous cures
effected, and testimonials received. The long list of
essences and decoctions, from vinegar to honey, also
have the names of distinguished gentlemen of the
faculty, the royal family, nobility, clergy, and gentry,
appended as bearing testimony to their surprising virtues.
“Highgate’s universal irresistible Ointment” we
are informed, is an invaluable specific for all disorders.</p>

<p class="no-indent">A counter address denounces the same individual as an
<em>uncertificated impostor</em>, who has no testimonials of his
own, but has filched extracts from the only real original
certificates and testimonials of “Monsieur Holabolo’s
genuine Panacea,” which alone is a radical cure for all
internal and external complaints. Another ointment
puffer, whose nostrum is warranted to cure the plague
and cholera, among other evils, occupies two columns of
a newspaper with cures said to be effected by it; and
these are flanked with no less than seventy-six names
of surgeons and oculists, who, among others, testify to
its monstrous virtues!!<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Now in all these quack advertisements, we find the
names, titles, and residences of the professional gentlemen
correctly given, which, possibly may be of some
consideration. Indeed, I know it is to some few an
advantage not to be overlooked, as their names are thus
kept before the public eye free of expense to them, and
they are, although indirectly, as effectually puffed into
notice as the quack himself. Without charging the
respectable and high-minded members of the profession
with entering into a compact, and designedly lending
the sanction of their name and office to these abominable
schemes of imposition, and granting full force to the
apologies they offer as to its “being customary;” “that
the profession generally do it;” “that to interfere would
be expensive and troublesome;” and that “it is the
fault of the public, who suffer themselves to be deluded
by such shallow artifices,” I conceive it to be the bounden
duty of every man of honour, when those tricksters
employ his name without his sanction or authority, to
adopt measures to disabuse that very large section of
society, who attach full credit to statements appearing
under such auspices.</p>

<p>But it is with spectacle advertisers that we are more
immediately concerned, and it is therefore essential to
convince every individual of ordinary capacity, that he
can, by the exercise of common sense, and the moderate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
use of his reasoning faculties, safely and judiciously
determine for himself, when spectacles are required, and
what powers and qualities they should possess; either
when the eyes first require restorative aid, or at any
subsequent period of life.</p>

<p>Amber spectacles have been bepraised and forced into
notice as much as any of these quack specifics. I
consider that the apathy and indifference manifested
by those who know the statements put forth to be a
tissue of falsehoods, are extremely reprehensible. No
wonder that thousands have been tricked and trifled with
when such novel and plausible pretensions have remained
unchallenged, and those who know them to be hollow
and deceitful artifices have suffered them to remain
unexposed. Amber is so soft that a proper degree of
polish cannot be given to it to make it suitable for spectacles.
The streaks, specks, veins, and irregularities in
it may be detected by the most casual observer. Glass
and pebbles assimilate closely to the composition of the
eye itself, but amber only imitates its diseased and
decayed appearance. When the powers of the eye
begin to decline, the crystalline humour becomes somewhat
yellow, and as the decay proceeds this tinge
increases.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Amber is strongly charged with electricity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
it has an affinity for oil, grease, and human perspiration;
“and it was from amber that the electrical fluid was first
obtained.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have received, by the
medium of the twopenny post, a printed circular, headed,
“<em>Amber Spectacles.</em>—M——having experienced from
the use of amber spectacles that which is expressed by
the following eminent gentlemen, considers it to be his
duty to caution the public against the use of them:—
“Amber is a soft substance, and it is impossible to
form it into a perfect lens, and a lens improperly constructed
would prove most injurious to vision. Amber,
in a moderate heat, becomes sticky; and by cleaning it
in a short time, the polish wears off. It is also easily
scratched, and soon loses the little transparency it possesses.
Glue, as to substance and colour, is quite equal
to it; and although purchasers pay an enormous price
for amber spectacles, yet they incur a great risk of
materially injuring their vision.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>If there even were any merit or superiority in amber
spectacles, be it observed, that the persons who prate
about <em>their</em> discovery, are not the parties who originated
or introduced the article. I have in my possession
several which were first brought to this country, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
sold by a Prussian mechanic, long before he came in
contact with individuals, who took a shameful advantage
of his forlorn situation, and, after deluding him with
specious promises, reduced him to their own terms.
The poor man found remonstrances to be unavailing;
and as he knew that redress was both uncertain and
expensive, he refrained from farther interference, sighing
as he said,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My poverty and not my will consents.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cautions respecting amber spectacles have frequently
appeared in the daily newspapers. On the 17th of
<span class="smcap">April</span>, 1838, the “<cite>Sun</cite>” contained a long advertisement,
lauding their extraordinary virtues. In the same page,
followed an exposé of the puff; and in another part of
the paper was the following paragraph, made to appear
as the editor’s remarks:—</p>

<p>“An advertisement appeared in our paper of the 9th
instant, calling into question the merits of patent amber
spectacles, which have been so highly recommended for
the preservative and assisting qualities for defective
vision, by men of high character and professional reputation.
The names of Messrs. Dollond and Curtis
being used, it is right that the public should be apprised
of the ascertained fact, that it owes its insertion, not to
the knowledge of those gentlemen, but to the personal
pique of interested individuals.”</p>

<p>Persons who are somewhat acquainted with the manner
in which such paragraphs are got up, well know what
importance is to be attached to them; the uninitiated,
however, are led to suppose that Messrs. Dollond and
Curtis were not of the opinions expressed, but that some
of the trade, jealous of the advertisers’ “high character,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
had maliciously questioned the “superior refractive property,”
“light modifying,” “cool,” and “soothing”
attributes of the admirable amber. But what ought we
to think of the professional and literary characters who
countenance the system of fraud and delusion practised
by puffing advertisers. We might in charity suppose
that the signatures of those eminent persons were surreptitiously
obtained; and in that case, the straight-forward
course they ought to adopt, should be publicly to
disavow all connection with the cheats. But if they
really hold the opinions attributed to them, we are bound
to declare that, opposed as such idle notions are to truth
and common sense, their presumption is ridiculous in
publishing opinions on a subject of which they are grossly
ignorant—ay, grossly ignorant! however capable and
popular they may be in their own professions. Indeed
many names of able and skilful surgeons are enumerated
in the list of patrons and testimonial writers, who
would smile at the effrontery of self-dubbed opticians,
and the credulity of the public, conscious that they had
no pretensions to any superior acquaintance with the
subject. The ingenious and talented Dr. Neill Arnott
remarks, in his “Elements of Physics,”—“Will it be
believed that <em>there are medical men</em> who neither understand
mechanics nor hydraulics, nor pneumatics, nor
optics, nor acoustics, beyond the merest routine; and
that systems of medical education are put forth at this
day, which do not even mention the department of
physics or natural philosophy;”</p>

<p>But a general diffusion of knowledge is changing the
condition of society, and elevating the human character.
At first we almost tremble at our own boldness, in
demanding proofs of the capability of our teachers; but
the mind, gathering power, and unfolding its strength,
with every opportunity for its manifestation, insists on
having positive proofs, rather than vague pretensions, and
demands solid information, instead of empty nothingness,
however gorgeously arrayed, or pompously introduced.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Some</span> instances which have come under my own cognizance
will illustrate the way in which gross imposition
is practised, and the public morals materially injured,
by weakening confidence in those who are, from their
education and rank, looked to as guides and preceptors,
and causing the mind to turn with indignation from the
needy, but debased and grovelling creatures, who resort
to any means, however infamous, to effect their selfish
purposes.</p>

<p>A military gentleman, of Stonehouse, was waited upon
by a renowned optical quack, who, the moment he
entered the parlour, exclaimed, “Goot Got, Sar! vy,
you are a’goin plind; the sight is leaving your left
eye! If you don’t immejartly take to my improved
classes I vill not answer for the konserkences; kataract
will grow on it in a month!” The gentleman, taken by
surprise, tried on some of the <em>preservers</em>, and finally
purchased two pairs of hand-folding spectacles, for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
he paid four pounds. Some time after, they were more
particularly inspected, and proved to be common glass,
instead of pebbles, as was represented, and of much
stronger focus than the eyes required. The full London
retail charge for <em>such</em> articles is 10<em>s.</em> per pair.</p>

<p>In the same town the same <em>distinguished</em> individual
forced his way into the study of a reverend gentleman,
and alarmed him by a similar prognostication. A pair
of the “clarified crystals, ground by a peculiar process,”
were purchased, price fifteen shillings. Afterwards,
upon finding that one eye was irritated, and derived no
assistance from the spectacles, the gentleman called upon
the optician who had always previously supplied him,
and was convinced of the trick which had been put upon
him. They were common machine-worked glasses, each
of a different focus, and neither of them suitable to his
sight. Their proper price, sold in their proper place
(viz., by hawkers, in the streets,) is one shilling per
pair!</p>

<p>A gentleman of Norwich, struck with the advantages
promised by some extraordinary spectacles, paid two
guineas for a pair of blue steel, with blue glasses, which
were warranted pebbles,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and had the additional vexation
to be severely censured by several friends, who
complained that the fellow had fixed them with similar
trash by representing that he (the gentleman) had said,
“After you leave mine, do you go down past the
Norfolk Hotel, and say I bid you to call on Mr. and
Mrs. ——, to sell them spectacles such as I have
bought.” This, of course, was a manœuvre of the cheat
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>A gentleman, of Tavistock, purchased a pair of silver
spectacles, declared to be very fine pebbles, price thirty-five
shillings; they were merely glass; and as he
required a glass in an old pair of spectacles, the pompous
hawker offered to <em>oblige</em> him by putting one of his
“clarified lenses” to match the focus: for this he
charged five shillings and sixpence. It was two inches
different in focal length to the original glass! which
would have been properly matched, by any resident
optician, for one shilling!</p>

<p>One of the hawking tribe called at the residence of
Major C——, near Hereford, and represented that
M——, Esq., had ordered, on the previous day, two
pairs of spectacles, and desired him to call upon his
friend, the major, to suit him also. In this case the
attack was parried; and, spite of the hawker’s vehement
declaration, that the eyes were in a terrible state, he was
dismissed, “to call again to-morrow.” Thus the major
preserved his eyes, and saved his money. In the evening
he saw his friend, and inquired if he had sent a fellow
to his house with spectacles? “No,” was the reply,
“but you sent him to <em>me</em>; for he came this afternoon,
saying you had bought two pairs, and wished me to
have some of the same kind; therefore, I bought two
pairs, and paid him the price he said <em>you</em> gave, viz., three
pounds, ten shillings, though at first he wanted four
guineas!”</p>

<p>A naval captain, residing at Monmouth, showed me a
pair of silver spectacles with six-inch focus glasses, very
jagged and splintered at the edges, worth at most twelve
shillings, for which he had given one of the tribe of impostors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
two guineas, and a pair of tortoiseshell (which
<em>did</em> suit his sight) into the bargain.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>A lady at Belfast was attracted by the showy advertisement
of an itinerant optician, and called upon him,
“between the hours of ten and six,” for the purpose of
purchasing a pair of spectacles. The first thing he did,
after staring at her, and impudently declaring that her
eyes were being ruined, was to snatch her spectacles
from her face, and put a pair of his own in their place.
“There, Matam! they are the spattacles for your
eyes, those you have peen vearing vill pring on kataract.”
“I see pretty well in these,” said the lady, “but my own
suit about as well, I think.” “Oh dear no, it’s quite a
mistake, your own are retched; put them on—isn’t
there a differench now, Matam?” “Yes, there is,” said
the lady, (who had too much penetration for the pedlar)
“they require cleaning after having been held in
your hot hand all this time;” and taking up a washleather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
she wiped the glasses, and, replacing them, bade
adieu to the <em>testimonialed</em> optician.</p>

<p>A lady, who was visiting for a few weeks at Margate,
was startled one morning, by a big, blustering, shewily-dressed
man, who, after knocking at the street door,
pushed past the servant, and rapping loudly at the parlour
door opened it without waiting for any reply.
“Goot morning, Matam, I am the optician to the royal
family; your friend, Lady W——, terives so much goot
from my pellucit lenses, she peggd me to call and suit
you.” Before all this had been uttered he had taken a
package from a confederate, dressed as a livery servant,
who accompanied him, and covered the table with his
stock. “Your eyes are in a most alarming state Matam,
this pair of cold spattacles will suit you.”
“Really,” said the lady; “how came Lady W—— to
suppose I wanted spectacles? I have never worn any at
any time in my life.” “No, that’s the vary reason your
sight is leaving you; your eyes are vary pad.” “What
is the price of this pair?” inquired the lady. “Three
guineas” was the answer. The price was paid; and
after punishing her eyes for a few days, the lady met
with a scientific friend who convinced her that they were
totally unfit and improper for her, her eyes being in excellent
order, and not requiring spectacles at all!</p>

<p>A gentleman, visiting at Canterbury, in 1834, was induced
through the representations of the same notorious
cheat to purchase a pair of spectacles, which were warranted
to dissipate the cataract forming in his eye; the
price paid was five pounds. As he was lamenting the
terrible state in which he was informed his eyes certainly
were (although, strange to say, he was quite unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of it) another pair was placed upon his nose, which, he
was told he ought to wear as a change, in case the eyes
were pained by the efforts of the first pair to dissipate
the cataract. Another five pound note was handed over
to the hawker, who began to grow quite pathetic; and
artfully alluding to the services of the gentleman during
the war, and expatiating upon a few circumstances with
which he had made himself acquainted in a chat with one
of the gossips at the public house where he lodged, he
pretended to lament the necessity for the gentleman
staying within doors. “What, may I not take a walk
or ride as usual? I can’t endure being cooped up within
doors.” “There’s danger in your going out,” said the
pedlar, “except your eyes are guarded with green Refractive
Preservers.” “Oh, bless me,” said the gentleman,
“that’s very serious; then you really think I
ought to have another pair for walking and riding, eh?”
“Oh certainly, by all means; nothing else can save
your eyes, unless you confine yourself within doors.”
“What’s the price of such a pair of preservers?” “Six
guineas, Sir; but as you have bought the others you shall
have them for five pounds.” “Why, dear me, I shall
be ruined in buying spectacles, and yet I never felt that I
wanted them before.” “That’s just the vay, ven the eyes
are a’going blind it comes on all at once, my tear Sir.”</p>

<p>By this transaction the pedlar actually pocketed three
five pound notes. In less than a week afterwards the
first two pair were sent to me to have the yellow coloured
glasses exchanged for white lenses of four degrees less
magnifying power; the price at which the whole three
pairs could have been purchased elsewhere would be
forty-five shillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>It will scarcely be credited that the individuals who
thus practise on the public are grossly ignorant; and
were it not that the anxiety of the purchasers to possess
something extraordinary renders them liable to imposition
and allays suspicion, such shallow pretensions never
would pass undetected.</p>

<p>One of the tribe, who, until lately, practised the art
and mystery of his forefathers as a dealer in old clothes,
suddenly changed his <em>profession</em>, and, calculating the
chances to be two to one in his favour, ventured, neck
or nothing, to blazon himself forth as an experienced,
scientific, and practical optician. A book, bearing his
name as its author, and sundry special appointments,
obtained by dint of the most brazen assurance and persevering
importunity, were ostentatiously paraded before
the wondering eyes of her majesty’s liege subjects. The
public are stultified, and the eminent individual himself,
is almost astonished that the scheme should take, and
like the “Fly preserved in amber, wonders how the
d—— he came there.”</p>

<p>There are artists in his locality who can give many
<em>graphic</em> illustrations of the disregard to truth, violation of
friendship, and cunning perversion of facts, of which this
individual has been guilty, and yet no one has a greater
array of eminent names and testimonials to show—many
signatures of really clever men having been obtained by
some means or other. Surely there is much piquancy
and truth in the Spanish proverb: “those who know
most are oftenest cheated.”</p>

<p>How often, too, accompanying such advertisements
as the preceding, do we find paragraphs, in the laudatory

<p><span class="smcap">Puff Paragraph</span>, No. 1.—We again call the attention of our
readers to Mr. —— and his valuable assortment of Spectacles.
They are manufactured with extraordinary care, and constructed
upon the strictest scientific principles. M. —— has for a long
period past devoted his attention exclusively to that important branch
of optics—the human eye;—and the proficiency he has attained of
the complicated structure of that noble organ has enabled him to
adapt glasses to every degree of defective vision. But the highest
panegyric which can be pronounced upon the skill of this artist, is
the unprecedented number of applications which have been made
to him.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> It is gratifying, however, to find that many editors of

<p>One of the puffing, <em>professional</em> licensed hawkers entered the
office of the Reading newspaper, and with the authoritative air of
an Alexander, desired that his announcement should appear in the
front column, and the <em>usual</em> laudatory paragraph in another part of
the paper. He was informed that his advertisement could be inserted,
but that the proprietors had determined never to admit such
insidious clap-trap notices, which, while they injured the resident
tradesman, and were looked upon as the <em>bona fide</em> opinions of the
editor, generally referred to matters of which he could not honestly
express a favourable opinion. The pedlar stood aghast! “What,”
said he, “not put in a paragraph? Why, I’d sooner pay for a
good paragraph than care about the advertisement at all.”</p>

<p>His <em>professional</em> visit was of unusually short duration, finding it
impossible to bribe the press to trumpet forth his praise.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I have</span>, for many years, visited nearly every town in
the kingdom, on commercial pursuits, at intervals of six
months; and wherever I have met with the brazen
advertisers alluded to, I have issued public notices,
and inserted counter-advertisements, to put my friends
and the public on their guard against such egregious
imposition. Such a step, spiritedly carried out, has uniformly
proved successful, and the notable pretenders
have decamped from Bath to Norwich, from Brighton to
Carlisle, sometimes assuming other names, or changing
the initial letters; as S. and E., who had been vapouring
away at Norwich, suddenly flitted to Margate, and
there announced themselves as C. and B., the celebrated
opticians from the Royal Eye Infirmaries, &amp;c. &amp;c. For
low cunning and unprincipled trickery, such adventurers
as I have described, stand unrivalled. Upon several
occasions they have echoed my cautions, and copied,
word for word, remarks levelled at themselves; hoping
thus to shield themselves from detection, and confuse
the public in identifying them; as the pick-pocket, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
the hue and cry is raised of stop-thief, joins in the
shout, in order to allay suspicion.</p>

<p>It is in the provincial towns that such persons are
most successful; the game is seldom played in the
metropolis with so much effect; and although some of
the tribe have been lately launching forth dashing advertisements
in the London papers, it is understood
to be with the design of attracting country customers,
and overwhelming their dupes with an idea of their
<em>professional</em> importance, rather than with the expectation
of effecting sales in London.</p>

<p>When they sally forth to “fleece the natives,” who
would think of questioning the abilities of such renowned
opticians, armed with testimonials, credentials, and
certificates! <em>so</em> recommended by the newspapers, and
patronized by such eminent practitioners?!!</p>

<p>The fair trader would defend himself at the same
time that he unmasked imposture, and protected his
customers, if, when his neighbourhood is infested by
such mountebanks, he advertised the simple truth. He
would assuredly find</p>

<p>A few extracts from the advertisements I have inserted
in the London and provincial journals may be
useful as specimens.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Spectacle swindlers are now practising deceptions upon the
public to an unparalleled extent! They are principally wandering
tribes of licensed hawkers, who change their names, or shift their
residences, as occasion requires; copy the language of honest men,
and puff off, as their own inventions, the very articles, which, without
a shade of difference, have been regularly made and sold for
above two hundred years. To accomplish their designs of fleecing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the public, they resort to the most pompous and extravagant eulogiums
on the peculiar virtues of their ‘Saxon Crystals!’ ‘Patent
Preservers!’ ‘Tinted Amber!’ and ‘Light Refractors!’ ridiculous
terms, which <em>they have</em> invented, and which, embellished with a
long list of distinguished names, are calculated to entrap, and impose
upon the uninitiated.</p>

<p>“Spectacle wearers, beware! those tricksters, with all their lofty
pretensions, are ignorant quacks. Their charges for the trash they
foist upon you, are beyond all precedent, enormous!</p>

<p>“The flagrant impositions daily practised on Spectacle wearers,
by hawkers and ignorant pretenders, imperatively demand exposure.
The boasting charlatans are certainly indebted to the silence
of practical opticians for their successful career, since persons requiring
optical aid eagerly listen to whoever promises most. To
those who have been victimized not another word is necessary to
direct their choice, but experience calls on all who need optical remedies
to profit by advice, and procure such important scientific
instruments only of the known working optician or his resident
agent, and thereby insure every advantage—better quality, lower
charges, a liberal trial, and an exchange if not approved of.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“The patronage such individuals quote has never been
bestowed, or has been surreptitiously obtained. Mr. C.
has documents from celebrated oculists stating this fact
most unequivocally, and authorizing him to give publicity
thereto. He has the gratification of knowing that
his efforts to expose such fraudulent delusions, to defend
the fair trader, and to protect the public, have been properly
appreciated by the reflecting and intelligent, who
perceive the impropriety of countenancing persons who
resort to falsehood, misrepresentation, and dishonest
artifices; and allow the superior claim of the respectable
resident shopkeeper, whose charges are fair, whose desire
and interest it obviously must be to supply the article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
which will suit and to make any exchange or alteration if
required.</p>

<p>“Beware of the tricksters who blazon forth their pretended
discoveries, in terms which, however absurd and
ridiculous, nevertheless catch the attention; and combined
with an array of great names, unbounded assurance,
and various manœuvring devices, enable them to foist
their worthless wares upon purchasers at the most exorbitant
prices.</p>

<p>“Such charlatans are the pests of science, and speculators
on the credulity of society.</p>

<p>“Mr. C. feels assured that his friends, and the public
generally, will remark the necessity there is for some
one, practically acquainted with the science of optics, to
come forward and state the real facts of the case, at a
time when bombast and chicanery, supported by the
most shameless falsehoods, are put forth by itinerant
hawkers and pedlars—the pretended discoverers of a superior
method of constructing glasses for spectacles.
He is anxious to expose such deceptions, and to protect
the Spectacle wearer from the gross frauds and impositions
continually practised in the sale of Spectacles at
enormous prices, although made of the cheapest material,
and in the most inferior manner.</p>

<p>“Such Spectacles are productive of endless annoyance
to the wearer; and, instead of rendering any assistance
are instruments of torture, producing the most serious
consequences to the sight, owing to their imperfect construction
and the misapplication of their powers to the
purposes required.</p>

<p>“Persons requiring Spectacles are earnestly recommended
to seek advice and assistance from opticians or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
their agents, of known respectability and experience, who
are capable of judging what kind of lenses are necessary
in each particular case: and to avoid those charlatans
whose ignorance of optics is only equalled by their impudence,
in obtruding themselves into houses, and
alarming the occupiers by declaring that they perceive
serious defects in their eyes, the formation of cataract,
incipient blindness, &amp;c., in order to give an exalted idea
of the value of the remedies they offer.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“T. H., Watch and Clock maker, agent to Cox, optician
of London, begs to caution his friends against the
impositions of itinerant hawkers, who boast of exalted
patronage, wonderful discoveries, and superior skill in
optics, professing to suit the sight by merely examining
‘the figure of the eye.’ Such individuals frequently
enter into respectable houses, and terrify ladies and gentlemen
by declaring that they perceive serious defects in
their eyes, and, of course, that nothing can avert the
evil but their wonderful Spectacles; sometimes pretending
that their only motive in calling is from their wish
to relieve mankind from the chances of losing their sight,
and to enable them to see as well at fourscore years of
age as at twenty, while their main object is to fill their
pockets at the expense of those who have fallen into
their snare.</p>

<p>“The fallacy of their statements may always be ascertained
by the parties taking medical opinion of known
value, and consulting a respectable optician.</p>

<p>“It cannot be too generally known that the best glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
lenses, constructed on the most accurate principles,
suited to the purposes of vision, and worked by hand,
can be had of all respectable opticians, at from one shilling
and sixpence to three shillings per pair, shewing
that there can be no occasion for persons, who require a
change of glasses in their spectacles, to pay a guinea or
thirty shillings, and give up their old pebbles or glasses
into the bargain.</p>

<p>“A trick was practised at Brighton, during the season
of 1834, which shews that those certificated gentry do
not hesitate at trifles.</p>

<p>“Two Jews, licensed hawkers, inserted glowing advertisements
in the Brighton newspapers, couched in their
usual bombastic style, but naming <em>one gentleman</em> only as
having taken up his residence at Brighton, and stating
that he would wait upon the nobility and gentry with a
splendid stock of his <em>wonderful</em> and <em>improved</em> Spectacles.</p>

<p>“A man called at the houses of the gentry, made
many sales at the usual swindling prices, and disarmed
all suspicions by inviting the purchasers to call at his
residence, and make any exchange they pleased. In
some cases, where the price was objected to, or the parties
were taken by surprise, not having suspected that
they wanted Spectacles until this <em>experienced professional
optician</em> told them they did, they were, notwithstanding
imposed upon, ‘for,’ said he, ‘to prove that I am anxious
to preserve your sight, which is rapidly leaving you, and
cataract is growing in your eyes, these Spectacles, which
are five pounds per pair, I will leave you at half-price,
and you may pay me the balance at any time.’ This
offer appeared so very liberal that it succeeded in several
instances, and, it is scarcely necessary to say, left to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
hawker forty shillings profit, five pounds being only
mentioned to get more easily the smaller sum.</p>

<p>“But the most profitable part of the scheme is yet to
be told. Those who purchased soon found that something
was wrong—the patent preservers gave great uneasiness
to the eyes, which, suffused with tears, seemed to grieve
at the simplicity and credulity of their owners. The
residence of Mr. —— was besieged with complaining
purchasers, who, when their turn arrived, were ushered
into the presence of the other of the partners, and as the
person who had sold them the Spectacles promised to
make any exchange they required, they asked for a pair
which would suit their sight, or a return of the money
paid. The man they now saw looked at them, and
asked, ‘Am I the person who sold you the spectacles?’
‘Why, no,’ was the reply, ‘I cannot say you were the
gentleman, but he was uncommonly like you, and he
told me he would exchange the Spectacles if they did
not suit.’</p>

<p>“‘Then you had better find him and compel him to
do so, for the trash he has sold you will destroy your
eyes and ruin your sight. He is an impostor; I know
nothing of him.’ ‘Bless me,’ said the disappointed
purchaser, ‘what a scandalous shame! what would
you advise me to do now, Sir?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, <em>my</em> Spectacles are produced after twenty years
of deep study and research, and manufactured, under my
own eyes, upon improved principles, yet I only ask fifty
shillings per pair; but I am sorry for you and though
those you have bought are vile rubbish, I will take them
in exchange, and thirty-five shillings for my Patent
Tinted Crystals, which are the only Spectacles proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
for the eyes.’ Thus the reader will perceive a double
imposition was effected. A., after performing his part
in the scheme of deception, kept out of the way until B.
had completed the fleecing of the nobility, gentry, and
public, and in a few weeks the <em>resident</em> opticians were on
their way to other places, chuckling at their success,
and inventing fresh plans of operation.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Page after page has been pirated from the works of
eminent authors, and palmed upon the public as their
own composition; consequently, though the advice may
be excellent, the parties from whom it appears to emanate
are vile plagiarists, whose <em>practice</em> is quite uninfluenced
thereby. When imposture disguises itself in
such a plausible form the difficulty of detection is increased,
therefore our best security against deception is
to transact business with men of known reputation.
The resident tradesman has a character for fair and
honourable dealing to maintain. He can be appealed to
if any exchange or alteration is requisite, and the spirit
of fair competition, now abroad, is the best security
against overcharge from him; while the itinerant vender
and pompous advertiser has to repay himself for such
forced and expensive means of getting custom by exacting
great prices, pushing off coarse and inferior goods,
and practising any dishonest trick rather than not effect
a sale of his wares. It may be said, with great truth,
“his articles are not cried up because they are things
that ought to be desired, but they are desired because
they are generally cried up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The Liverpool Mercury of Friday, Sep. 15th, 1834, has
some remarks on this subject, which, as they are important
and appropriate to our purpose, I transcribe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We beg to caution our readers against the arts of all those who
profess to supply the public with superior Spectacles; we have been
for many years connected with the business, and we can assure the
public that the Spectacle glasses sold by the advertising eye quacks
are precisely the same as those provided by any respectable optician,
the only difference being in the price. The charlatan varies his
charge according to the gullibility of his dupes; sometimes he puts
up with double the proper and regular price, but more frequently he
exacts three or four times more than a regular and honest optician
charges. We recollect a once famous optical quack, in London,
who made a large fortune by cheating the public. He advertised
<em>his</em> superior glasses, which he assured the public were all ground to
the true parabolic curve by his own hand, and for each of these
glasses he charged four shillings, whilst the working optician who
lived a few doors from him, and who furnished him with all his
glasses, could only get nine pence for the very article for which the
puffing eye doctor charged four shillings. As we knew both the
parties we pledge ourselves to the fact, and, in conclusion, we advise
the public to have nothing to do with quacks, whether they be
scientific quacks, who are plentiful enough, or other quacks, who
swindle people out of their health and cash at the same time.”</p>

<p>J. Hodson, Esq., consulting Oculist to the Eye Infirmary,
Birmingham, resolved upon coming to London
to give me his disclaimer, rather than incur any chance
of misrepresentation from an unjustifiable use being
made of his signature, he being an entire stranger to me
before I addressed him upon this subject.</p>

<p>He authorizes me to state that Mr. —— has no authority
or right whatever to make use of his name.
About four years since a man came to his surgery, and
introducing himself as the inventor of roseate tint preservers
and amber spectacles, showed him a pair in silver
frames, and, expatiating upon their wonderful properties,
mentioned the names of several leading surgeons and
oculists who had inserted their signatures in a book
which he handed to Mr. Hodson, who, without suspecting
the design of the knave, added his to the list,
for the same reason, he said, that folks do so at a watering
place, a library, or as having visited or seen some
particular exhibition—in fact, because it was customary
to do so. Four or five days afterwards the same individual
called again, apparently in great haste, and requested
Mr. H. to lend him two sovereigns, as he had
immediate occasion for that sum. He produced a pair
of amber spectacles, and said, “I will leave these as security
until I return the money.” Mr. H. began now
to suspect the fellow, and guessed it to be very unlikely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
that he would trouble himself to redeem the Spectacles
(worth about twelve shillings) if he succeeded in raising
two pounds upon them; he therefore referred him to a
pawnbroker in the neighbourhood, whose business it was
to enter into such arrangements, which were, clearly
quite foreign to his, Mr. H.’s practice.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodson has ever since regretted having (though
inadvertently) given his signature, which, as the reader
will perceive, is solicited as a mere matter of form, and
is then made the most unwarrantable use of, involving
the parties in many dilemmas, and exposing them to the
ridicule and reprehension of every intelligent observer.</p>

<p>The fact is, if one signature of an eminent person
can be procured by dint of false representation or
plausible pretence, the rest follow as a matter of
course; thus Mr. Hodson signed his name, seeing that
some of the “heads of colleges” were there inscribed.
Mr. Soden, of Bath, gave his signature because Mr.
Ledsam had given his; and Mr. Ledsam signed because
Mr. Hodson had done so.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander, Oculist to the Royal Family, was
waited upon by one of the crafty crew, whose object
was to get his signature at all hazards. The fellow
fawned and entreated, but was sternly resisted by Mr. A.
who showed him the door, and declared, if he presumed
to make use of his name, in his quack advertisements,
he would set a solicitor to work immediately.</p>

questions put to me by you, being in utter ignorance of the use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
which you propose to make of my answer; yet I can have no
hesitation in saying that I think Mr. —— has been guilty of an
unpardonable liberty in publishing my name, without my sanction,
and more especially in appending it to the document (a copy of
which you sent to me), and to which I have never affixed my
signature. I was requested to look at M ——’s amber spectacles,
and I saw no others; and looking through them on a day when the
sun shone brightly, they appeared to me to soften the light more than
crystal or pebbles; and seeing the names of many eminent surgeons
and oculists attached to various certificates, I wrote and signed what
I have stated above, and I believe no more; namely, that the amber
spectacles seemed to <em>soften the light</em> more than the pebbles.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
I am not aware of having seen any other sort; and certainly I have
not ventured to sign my <em>approval</em> of these, or of any others.</p>

<span class="smcap">Robert Keate</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>To Mr. George Cox.</p>
</div>

<p>I could give the disclaimers of other gentlemen who
have been trepanned into giving their signatures, which
are afterwards so pompously paraded by the testimonialed
and certificated adventurers; but these will suffice
to illustrate the working of the system.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I cannot but feel gratified, that this correspondence,
while it has substantiated my arguments, affords an
opportunity for those gentlemen to explain the real truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
of the matter, and to exonerate themselves from the
contaminating connexion, which appeared to place their
reputation for that “quality called honesty” in jeopardy.</p>

<p>I have received several impromptu effusions from
humorous correspondents in different parts of the kingdom,
where I have been and unmasked the impositions
of spectacle cheats. One says—</p>

</div>

<p>I have, of course, laid myself open to the furious and
vindictive hostility of those quacks, whose nefarious
practices are exposed, and whose career will be checked
in proportion as this treatise is circulated and dispassionately
perused. But, secure of the approbation of
all my readers who will avail themselves of the information
contained in these pages, I may conclude with
satisfaction, since</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> When the eyes are distressed and overwhelmed with light, <em>any</em>
shade or screen is viewed with satisfaction. Coloured glasses
“soften the light” more naturally, and present to the eye equal and
parallel surfaces: parasols, veils, and even opaque substances, may
thus be said to shield the eye, and “modify bright and strong light,”
but it would be as ridiculous to consider these as fit mediums for the
ordinary purposes of vision, as it is to select amber for the purpose.</p>
